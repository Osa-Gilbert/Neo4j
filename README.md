BUSINESS PROBLEM:
The use of Neo4j to enhance the tourist experience through personalized itinerary recommendations.
DESCRIPTION 
A French tourism board is striving to become a top tourist destination by providing an exceptional and tailored experience for its visitors. The goal is to develop a smart system that recommends personalized itineraries for tourists, considering their preferences, location, time constraints, and other factors. Furthermore, the board wants to analyze the existing tourism infrastructure and identify opportunities for improvement, such as transportation connectivity, accommodation distribution, and the variety of attractions. To achieve this, the board will use Neo4j, a graph database, to model the ‘TouristDestination’ attractions, accommodations, transportation facilities, and other relevant entities. The graph model will enable the board to efficiently navigate the complex relationships between these entities and generate itinerary recommendations based on tourist inputs. Additionally, by analyzing the graph, the board can identify infrastructure gaps and prioritize investments to enhance appeal to tourists.
